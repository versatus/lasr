# lasr_types

## Overview

This crate provides LASR types that are necessary for building, and developing Programs on the LASR network. 

The program input and output data is serialized/deserialized to/from Rust data structures, which you can find and use via this [crate](https://crates.io/crates/lasr_types).

## Rust Installation

The [Official Rust Docs](https://www.rust-lang.org/) provide instructions for the installation and maintenance of Rust installations for a number of different supported use cases. Versatus has been careful to not rely on too much bleeding-edge Rust functionality and should be compatible with whichever version of Rust you're likely to be using.
